# DPIorDIE
Hello! This is a plugin designed to filter images based on the DPI of an image only a specific type of user can upload, "Uploader". It reads the EXIF data to get the DPI for now. It can also increase the max upload size to your desired choosing. There's also the ability to upload said images to Dropbox in a dedicated app folder and offset path. It seamlessly integrates with Wordpress and I've done the work for people to commit translations.
